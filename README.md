### Comprehensive-Design-Analysis-of-a-4R-Serial-Spatial-Manipulator

- Successfully designed and developed a 4 Degree of Freedom (DOF), Serial, Spatial Robot Manipulator, analogous to a Pick-n-Place Arm.
- Utilized SOLIDWORKS to create a detailed 3D model of the manipulator, ensuring optimal functionality and performance.
- Employed cutting-edge 3D printing techniques for the precise assembly of links, bringing the manipulator to life.
- Generated Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters and constructed the DH Table, establishing a robust kinematic foundation.
- Calculated transformation matrices to seamlessly map the manipulator's movements from the end effector to the ground.
- Computed the Jacobian matrix for comprehensive velocity analysis and precise control of the robot.
- Employed Matrix Exponential approach in MATLAB to solve for jacobian, forward and inverse kinematics.
